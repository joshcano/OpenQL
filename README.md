OpenQL
=====

This project is the first attempt to standardize a Quantum Computing API for general purpose computing on quantum computers (GPQPU). 

Looking Forward
-----
The next phase in standardization is to pull the Qbit-Vector Phasor Language (QVPL) out of our asses; this requires introducing unnecessary keywords and syntax into something completely un-related to what we need to do.
